\section{General ideas}
\label{sec:general-ideas}

\section{Nuclear crater}
\label{sec:nuclear-crater}

Due to an explosion of the nuclear variety, the adventurers are sent into the
large crater\ldots{}.

\subsection{Hooks}
\label{sec:hooks-1}

\subsubsection{\emph{Aliens!}}
\label{sec:emphaliens}

The crater was caused by alien contact and there is a surviving alien at the
centre that they must retrieve alive (or for certain other contractors who will
contact the characters individually, dead for a higher fee).

\subsubsection{Evidence collection}
\label{sec:evidence-collection}

The company responsible for the explosion doesn't want it's involvement getting
out. The team need to get in and out taking or destroying any evidence with
them.

Of course, they are not the only ones after the loot. Battle may ensue, made
even worse by radioactive dust kicked up by every explosion.

\subsubsection{\thecompany requires\ldots{}}
\label{sec:thec-requ}

\thecompany needs the technology used to create that blast, so it's sending in
it's best team! Or at least it's most expendable\ldots{}

(This is very similar to \ref{sec:evidence-collection} but the end goal is
different.)

\section{Session 1}

\subsection{Hooks}
\label{sec:hooks}

\subsubsection{The angry boss}
\label{sec:angry-boss}

\paragraph{Basic idea}

Players are told beforehand that something is going to happen and they are going
to have to improv. Whatever they say will be accepted as true (or a lie if they
want). The characters then enter a room where the boss shouts ``What the hell
happened? You killed the wrong guy!'' \emph{Cue improv.}

\paragraph{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't need to know much about the characters
\item Shows people's colours quickly
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't lead anywhere by default
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The job}
\label{sec:job}

\paragraph{Basic idea}

The team get given a job, Charlie's Angels style: rob a mafia bank. Payout is
given \emph{on delivery} but only a certain amount must be stolen (client's
wishes). If more is stolen the team will be in trouble.

\paragraph{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item \player{Thief} will totally steal more
\item Can split the party to go information searching
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This even means that David and I can find different information and
    combine it (making more improv.\ excellency)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cons}

Will have to prep a building for everyone to get involved in. Basically design
an entire challenge.

\subsubsection{Kidnapped daughter of a CEO}
\label{sec:kidn-daught-ceo}

As Google Doc.


\chapter{Reusable NPCs}
\label{cha:reusable-npcs}

\section{Armed mook}
\label{sec:armed-mook}

Simple enough. Use this template for any NPC who is prepared for a fight but
the GM hasn't prepared them for it. They will die quickly and will probably
immediately fail any HT roll for falling unconcious/dying.

They have the following weapon:
\begin{innateattack}
  \item Needs \dice{3} of damage so make it \InnateAttackLevel{3}
  \item Attack type pi means \InnateAttackPointsPerLevel{5}
  \item No point in extending the range (can assume infinite, won't be shooting
    far anyway!)
  \item That makes this weapon \InnateAttackTotalPoints.
\end{innateattack}

\chapter{Recurring NPCs}
\label{cha:recurring-npcs}

\section{Quintapod 5000}
\label{sec:quintapod-5000}

% Initially designed as HiveMind™ security bots by UrRobotNeeds Ltd., the Quintapod~5000 is a small adaptable, arachnid-like bot with 5 legs and basic visual and audio inputs. It's main feature are the 10 chip slots which can be used for weaponry, extra compute power, adding specific skills, etc.. They work best in packs but due to their low cost are often used as little assistants for menial work/basic security.

% When left to their own devices without explicit programming they are naturally curious and seek out pre-programmed threats. Since they have HiveMind™ capabilities, they automatically link up with other friendly quintapods and share their sensory input. If found in a combat situation a hive will favour aiming first, using Hive Aim (see below) then shooting en masse.

% It takes 1~minute to change the module(s) on the quintapod. Upgrades are available at 3.5 points/level for Modular Abilities (Chip Slots). The GM has the final say on what is possible; modular abilities should be consistent with the rest of the quintapods features (e.g. not lifting more than basic lift, etc.).


% % Created by UrRobotNeeds Ltd., the Quintapod~5000 is the latest in affordable
% % security technology. Measuring at just under 2 ft with a single adaptable module
% % slot, 5 legs and an automated prowler mode, a fleet of Quintapod~5000s is an
% % impressive addition to any security team. It comes with a laser rifle installed
% % as standard which is sure to intimidate any minor threats your bots may
% % encounter. The 5000 comes with the latest in HiveMind™ technology which allows
% % it to share sensory data with nearby Quintapods giving fast target recognition
% % and coordinated attacks with a maximum of 99 additional units. Mesh networking
% % allows for networks extending much further.

% % When left alone, quintapods are naturally curious and will seek out targets they
% % deem to be threats to security. What \emph{is} a threat to security depends on
% % what they have been told by their current master.

% % Quintapods are often used as helpers for engineers due to their low cost and
% % modular abilities. Thier slots can be extended by increasing the level of
% % Modular Abilities (Chip Slots) for 3.5~points/level. (Final points for Modular
% % Abilities are rounded up.) GM has final say on how much this can be upgraded
% % without upgrading the frame's ST/HT (e.g.~fitting a large gauss cannon on the top
% % of a quintapod is probably not possible without \emph{significant} modifications
% % to the underlying bot).

\subsection{Abilities}
\label{sec:abilities}

\begin{description}
\item[Language: Beeps and boops] The language of beeps and boops is uniquely
  suited to the kinds of things a quintapod would want to communicate. Any
  communications attempting to convey location, security details, bot operations
  or anything the GM feels appropriate is transmitted at 5x speed. (Details that
  bots wouldn't usually talk about is transmitted at 0.2x speed, e.g.~describing
  art work.)
\item[HiveMind™] Any quintapods within range automatically attempt to form a
  MindLink which transmits sight, sound and location.
\item[Hive Perception] If any quintapod passes a perception roll, it may
  communicate this to any linked quintapods as a free action. (This is really a
  combination of Absolute Direction, MindLink and Language: Beeps and boops.)

\section{Leslie ``Trunchball'' Dyers}
\label{sec:lesl-trunchb-dyers}

Leslie ``Trunchball'' Dyers is a strong woman, \emph{literally!} The kingpin of
her own empire, Trunchball has built \thecompany from the ground up into one of
the premier bounty hunter associations in \system{51}. Despite this obvious
success, she has never been able to find the approval of her parents who own a
small moon on Krattha (4th planet from the Sun).

Leslie has a younger sister, Debbie (see \ref{sec:debbie-dyers}
), with whom she has a difficult relationship with. Although she is loathe to
mention it, she sometimes calls on her sister's renowned bounty hunter skills
when \thecompany's people are in need of a miracle.

\section{Debbie Dyers}
\label{sec:debbie-dyers}

Debbie Dyers is an \emph{independent contractor}\footnote{I.e.~someone who is a
  bounty hunter who does not belong to an external organisation} who is
legendary in the right circles. She comes from a long line of hunters, the first
of which was recorded on earth who was allgegedly a `monster hunter' according
to family folklore

An imposing figure at 6'2" with fiery red hair which extends to her shoulders.
She is usually sporting a trenchcoat which hides her extensive weaponry and
equipment.

Markedly against bio-enhancements, she has a special vest (i.e.~Signature Gear)
which gives her 360\textsuperscript{o} heat vision allowing her to aim at
two (heat based) targets at once.

Little known sister to Leslie ``Trunchball'' Dyers
(p.~\pageref{sec:lesl-trunchb-dyers}), Debbie is viewed as the `golden child' by her
parents despite Trunchball's success in building \thecompany up from nothing.
Debbie works for \emph{Dyers Independent}, a private bounty hunter company with
one employee: Debbie.

  \item Clip of 10 means \InnateAttackPercentModifier[Clip of 10]{-10} with Limited Use
  \item Recoil is pretty bad for the base (Rcl 3) so
    \InnateAttackPercentModifier[Recoil 3]{-20}
  \item Accuracy needs taking down a little to 2 (so that rifles are more
    accurate than pistols) so \InnateAttackPercentModifier[Accuracy 2]{-5}
  \item It's \emph{loud} which means a single level of Nuisance Effect at
    \InnateAttackPercentModifier[Nuicanse (noise)]{-5}
